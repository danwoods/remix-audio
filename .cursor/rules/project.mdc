This is a Deno codebase and as such should strive to use Deno's built in functionality as much as possible.

This codebase will have EXCELENT test coverage. Any change should result in a new or updated test.

You must write tests one at a time and run them to ensure they pass before doing ANYTHING else. NEVER write more than one test at once.

This codebase will have EXCELENT documentation, and will follow Deno best practices with regard to documentation.

This codebase produces an application that allows playing music.

This codebase does not cut corners. NEVER do things like commiting/pushing with --no-verfiy or disabling tests.

## UI

This codebase uses a custom HTML element approach to building UIs.

This codebase uses icons based on svg from https://heroicons.com
